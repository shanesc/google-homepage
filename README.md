## The Odin Project - Recreate the Google Homepage ##

This is a small project to recreate the Google homepage.

As part of [The Odin Project's HTML/CSS section](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css#assignment), I will be using semantic HTML and CSS properties to create a page identical to the Google search page.

### Learning Notes ###

I was surprised with how long it takes to get the layout precisely how you want it to look. I went into this project thinking I could get it done in an hour, but it took a few.

I was able to get all of the layout and hover, focus, etc. effects to  match very closely with the Google homepage, which was satisfying.

I used:
* Semantic HTML whenever possible.
* Some more advanced CSS properties, such as the `:hover` and `:not(:last-child)` psuedo-classes, as well as a `@media` query to change the layout up slightly to look better on larger screens (I used a mobile-first approach, then sized up for screen over 800px wide).
* Codepen.io to debug some issues with my media query. What a useful tool! You can quickly try something out without the hassle of setting up a new project folder or edit your files.

I then followed some of the videos and articles outlining how to contribute to open source, and added my solution to the list on the markdown file.
The steps for this are:
1. Fork the main Odin Project curriculum repo.
2. Create a clone of the forked repo on your local machine.
3. Make the changes through a series of `git commit`s.
4. Once I was ready to add my changes, setup an `upstream` remote branch and fetch, merge the most recent version to ensure I'm up-to-date.
5. Push my changes to the remote forked repo.
6. Finally, open a pull request to pull my forked repo into the main Odin Project repo.

Some solid learning in this project!
